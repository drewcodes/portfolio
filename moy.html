                <h2>Grandmaster Moy Yat</h2>
                <p><img align="left" id="moyyat-pic" src="http://www.vingtsunsaopaulo.com.br/images/sigung.jpg">One of Ip Man's closest disciples was Grandmaster Moy Yat, whom he was first introduced to in 1957. For 15 years, Moy Yat kept a close relationship with Ip Man, living the "Kung Fu Life." It was at this time that he learned from Ip Man the principles and deeper aspects of Ving Tsun (also known as "Wing Chun").</p>
                <p>Never far from Ip Man's side, Grandmaster Moy Yat eventually developed into one of his top disciples. In 1973 Grandmaster Moy Yat came to the United States where he began teaching kung fu in New York City. It was in Brooklyn where the seed of the Moy Yat Ving Tsun Kung Fu family was planted. Moy Yat would soon develop a loyal following of students, many of whom had sought him out to learn authentic kung fu. Just as Ip Man had done in Hong Kong, GrandMaster Moy Yat followed his sifu's example and used the same method to teach his own students. He instilled upon his students the importance of "Kung Fu Life," the use of the Ving Tsun principles in everyday life. He always said that Ving Tsun Kung Fu can best be learned outside the classroom. To his last days, Grandmaster Moy Yat lived his life very much in this way, spending his time living and teaching Ving Tsun through "Kung Fu Life."</p>
                <p>Grandmaster Moy Yat is still well respected in the community, as a kung fu teacher and as an accomplished artist. His paintings, calligraphy and stone carvings can be seen throughout his Chinatown school, as well as in art shows which were held regularly in the city. Grandmaster Moy Yat retired from teaching physical kung fu on his 60th birthday, but continued to teach the principles of Kung Fu through "Kung Fu Life," as well as teaching art and massage up until his passing. The Moy Yat Kung Fu Family is quite extensive, with students throughout the world spreading the art of Ving Tsun. His disciples are teaching Ving Tsun in their own schools throughout the United States and around the world, with schools as far reaching as Canada, Brazil, and Mexico.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"If someone ask you what is kung fu, the answer: kung fu is life. So then, another question: what is life? Life is everything..."</p>

With schools located worldwide, none is more specially recognized than the NYC branch, which serves as the official Moy Yat Headquarters. This school is led by Grandmaster Moy Yat's son, Sifu William Moy.</p>
                    <p>In passing on the art of Ving Tsun, Grandmaster Moy Yat taught his son in the same fashion as Ip Man taught: Dedicated, consistent and progressive mastery of the art. Sifu William Moy spent his nights attending classes alongside his kung fu brothers. Being the Grandmaster's son didn't give Sifu William any advantage. In fact, Sifu William sought to learn the art through the same traditional ways that his father had learned Ving Tsun from Ip Man.</p>
                    <p>Today, Sifu William Moy has over 25 years of experience teaching the art of Ving Tsun Kung Fu. Sifu William continues to teach using the same methods of both his father's and Ip Man's tradition. Passionately motivated by his students and their quest for authentic, yet functional Ving Tsun Kung Fu, Sifu William Moy continues the tradition set in motion by his father over forty years ago.</p>

                <h3>Siu Nim Tao</h3>
                <p>Siu Nim Tao is the first form in the Ving Tsun Kung Fu system. The name "Siu Nim Tao" translates as "Little Idea" or "Little Imagination." Siu Nim Tao lays down the foundation for a Ving Tsun practicioner to learn the proper hand movements and techniques needed for later application. The form is practiced in a very controlled stance.</p>
                <h3>Chum Kiu</h3>
                <p>Chum Kiu is the second form of the Ving Tsun system. Chum Kiu translates to "Seeking the Bridge." Alongside some hand techniques, Chum Kiu introduces students to their first development of proper footwork and closing the space between oneself and their opponent. Unlike Siu Nim Tao, Chum Kiu is practiced with the movement of one's entire body, rather than a stationary stance.</p>
                <h3>Biu Jee</h3>
                <p>Biu Jee is the third, and final hand form, in the Ving Tsun system. Biu Jee means "thrusting fingers" and is applied as an emergency form to regain control of the practicioner's centerline. Biu Jee goes beyond just thrusting fingers, as this form includes additional footwork and several new hand techniques.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                <h3>Muk Yan Jong</h3>
                <p>"Muk Yan Jong" literally translates to "wooden man" and is considered a training tool to practice all the various hand and foot techniques from the first three forms. The form is practiced on a wooden dummy that has three arms and a leg to emulate an opponent.</p>
                <h3>Luk Dim Boon Kwun</h3>
                <p>Luk Dim Boon Kwun translates to "Six and a Half Point Pole." The "points" are actually the techniques utilizing a long pole. This form also covers unique footwork and a stance that is essential to maneuvering the long pole accurately.</p>
                <h3>Baat Cham Dao</h3>
                <p>The last and final form is the Baat Cham Dao form. "Baat Cham Dao" translates to "eight cut knife" which is the number of techniques covered. Baat Cham Dao is only taught to students who have successfully mastered all previous techniques and forms.</p>
