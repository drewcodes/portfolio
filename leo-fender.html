                    <li>Unknown to most people, Leo Fender had pursued a career in accounting before getting involved with musical instruments.</li>
                    <li>Leo Fender had no formal education-training in electronics. HIs experience was strictly self-taught.</li>
                    <li>Leo opened his "Fender Radio Service" shop in 1938. The shop was intended to service radios, but bands and musicians began approaching his shop in search of public address systems and amplifiers for lap steel guitars.</li>
                    <li>The Stratocaster, Leo's second electric guitar design was famously used by Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton.</li>
                    <li>Despite building guitars for a living, Leo Fender barely knew how to play one.</li>
                    <li>In 1968, Leo Fender had to sell "Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company" to CBS due to an illness. He unexpectedly fully recovered and continued building instruments under the names "Music Man" and "G&L".</li>
